I have spent more than half of my 15 year career as a remote employee,
bravely venturing down the Lego-strewn hallway in my bare feet to my
home office where I work as a `{DevOps,Site Reliability,Systems,Technical Operations}` Engineer,
automating all the things.

## Why telecommute?

I'll keep this short because I think the personal benefits of working from a home
office are relatively obvious.  For me, the flexibility of living where I want to live
is my primary motivation. I reside in a
tiny town in upstate New York near extended family so my children can grow up knowing their
relatives.  I have property larger than a postage-stamp and can look at a mountain from my
office window, all while reaping the benefits of working for companies in major metropolitan
areas.
Were I to take a job in my region, it would come with half the salary and add 2 hours of
commute time each day.  Need to visit Mom for a couple days?  No problem...pack the laptop,
MiFi, and headset and I'm good to work from her dining room table.  Just don't get
water rings on the table!

Outside of the quality of life benefits, there are practical work
benefits.  I don't have to sit in a toxic open-office environment being constantly
distracted by conversations around me. Unnecessary meetings and walk-up interruptions
are minimized. I schedule my time how I want and work asynchronously, answering chat
and email messages during downtime rather than interrupting my focus on a project.

## But, there are challenges.

It's not all sunshine and roses punctuated by dancing unicorns. There are a few challenges
as a remote employee and this is what I want to focus on.

### Staying productive

When you are sitting by yourself for hours on end and you've got the Internet and
household chores to distract you, it's sometimes difficult to maintain focus.  This is the
easiest one to let slip away gradually and before you know it, you're getting up at 11AM, taking
2 hour lunches, and closing up shop at 4PM. None of these are hard and fast rules and I follow
them with varied success on a day-to-day basis, but they are reasonable best practices. Early
on it's especially important to make rules for yourself and only break them once you find
your groove.

* **Define your business hours and stick to them.**  This has the effect of maintaining
  "work mode" while also preventing 2AM from sneaking up on you while fixing that
  race condition that you only happens when the moon is in its waxing gibbous
  phase on the vernal equinox. Communicate these hours to your
  coworkers through simple indicators such as saying "Morning" and "'night" in the team chat room or
  by setting your away status.  Your team will also learn your patterns and (hopefully) begin
  to respect them. Be cognizant of critical tasks, but correct problematic off-hours "pingers"
  by responding with notes like, "I'll check that out when I sign on in the morning." Just because
  you gained 2 hours of your life back from eliminating a commute doesn't mean you have to
  work them.

* **Set clear boundaries for family.** These boundaries need to be both spatial and temporal.
  Work time is work time. Your office is an office, not a racetrack. During work hours
  Little Miles cannot come in to play spaceships with you every 5 minutes. Your
  spouse can't be expecting you to be mowing the lawn and taking care of the dishes. *You are
  at work, even though your office is in the same structure as your home.*

* **Put on your damn pants.** No, really. Do you think you're going to do your best work while
  sitting around in those plaid pajama pants your wife gave you for Christmas half a decade ago.
  Attire helps reinforce positive habits and clearly delineate chill time from work time,
  particularly when you're new at this. And think of your co-workers.  No one wants to see you
  wearing you wearing the same pizza stained Pearl Jam t-shirt day after day in your morning scrum.
  Groom yourself and shower - pretend you're going to a "real job," because you are.

* **Redefine productivity.** You no longer are restricted by the idea that work has to occur while
  sitting in a chair, at a desk, in front of a computer.  I find it challenging to perform the
  creative aspects of my job while chained to a desk. Without so many judgmental eyes upon you,
  you are free to stand up, go for a walk, mow the lawn, or take a bath and contemplate that new
  architecture that you're trying to invent.

* **Track your time.** If you're having trouble measuring your productivity, there's an
  app for that.  I use [RescueTime](http://www.rescuetime.com) which tracks the active
  window (or tab in your browser) and allows you to categorize your time on a scale from
  "Very Distracting" to "Very Productive."  The privacy sensitive among you may not like the tracking
  aspects of RescueTime and may prefer an app such as [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) which
  allows you to track time by project and activity.  Disclaimer: I have not used Toggl.

* **Be flexible.** These aren't hard rules.  Maybe playing spaceships with Miles for a
  few minutes once in a while is the best possible thing you can do for your sanity
  or productivity. Get out of your office and work on the patio on that nice summer day.
  Here's a secret: I fold laundry during conference calls.  You work from home. It's awesome,
  so take advantage of it.

### Communicating with peers

It's hard communicating ideas, staying in touch, and
avoiding "out of site out of mind" syndrome when you're not sitting next to your
coworkers.

* **Don't be an ass{hat,hole}**

### Loneliness and Cabin Fever

Sitting at the same desk, staring at the same walls for days on end can get to the best of us.

## Equipment/Technology

A lot has changed since the days of dial-up Internet,
emailed source code files, and screen sharing sessions over Microsoft NetMeeting making
the technological aspects of remote work much simpler.  I try to minimize the emphasis
on technology and instead focus on a few very practical and flexible solutions.

* **Get a high-quality wireless headset.**  It needs to fucking work. How can you
  work from home if you cannot
