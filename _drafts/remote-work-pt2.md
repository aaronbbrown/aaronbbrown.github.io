### Communicating with peers

It's hard communicating ideas, staying in touch, and
avoiding "out of site out of mind" syndrome when you're not sitting next to your
coworkers.

* **Don't be an ass{hat,hole}**

### Loneliness and Cabin Fever

Sitting at the same desk, staring at the same walls for days on end can get to the best of us.

## Equipment/Technology

A lot has changed since the days of dial-up Internet,
emailed source code files, and screen sharing sessions over Microsoft NetMeeting making
the technological aspects of remote work much simpler.  I try to minimize the emphasis
on technology and instead focus on a few very practical and flexible solutions.

* **Get a high-quality wireless headset.**  It needs to fucking work. How can you
  work from home if you cannot
