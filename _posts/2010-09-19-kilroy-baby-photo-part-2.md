[<img class="alignleft" style="float: left;" src="http://blog.9minutesnooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4931504133_1dd26e0171.jpg" alt="Kilroy II" />][1]There&#8217;s not much to say about this shot, except that I think it&#8217;s pretty cute. We moved and our new place has a passthrough between the kitchen and living room. My 16 month old boy has become quite the climber and likes to stand on the back of the couch and watch us as we are preparing meals. Â I took this shot, to complement my previous shot of him in his crib from last December [Kilroy Was Here][2]. Â This time, it was candid with no additional lighting. Â I used a Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens at f/2.0 and ISO 800 on aperture priority mode. Â Because I was inside and he is backlit, I pumped up the exposure compensation to +2/3.

I didn&#8217;t manipulate the photo very much aside from some white balance, contrast adjustments, and sharpening. Here is the original shot:
