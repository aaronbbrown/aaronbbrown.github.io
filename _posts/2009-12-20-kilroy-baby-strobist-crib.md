<a class="" rel="" title="Kilroy was Here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/59244043@N00/4201332693/"><img class="alignleft" style="float: left;" src="http://blog.9minutesnooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/4201332693_d60d153941.jpg" alt="Kilroy was Here" /></a>John is 7.5 months old and is now pulling himself up onto his legs in his crib and his play area. How did I take this shot? I dropped the mattress in the crib by 8 inches and John just stood up and started making like [Kilroy][1].

Ok, so I might have grabbed a flash (Canon 430EX) and stuck it on a light stand with a shoot-through umbrella up high and camera right. You can tell by looking at the [catch light][2] in his eyes what kind of light modifier was used. In fact, at 100%, you can see the ribs of the umbrella. The strobe was on 1/8&#8243; power and I was shooting my Canon EF50mm f/1.8 at f/5. The camera was on ISO 400. It took exactly 2 shots to lock in the exposure. So far, in my experience, light meters are completely useless.

I edited the photo in Adobe Lightroom and used the same techniques as in my post on &#8220;[Great Eyes in Lightroom][3].&#8221; I did do a bunch of spot work with the Spot Healing tool in Lightroom, and then I did a little bit of cloning in Photoshop CS4 afterwards. Basically, I edited out a few blemishes and some left over pears from his dinner.

He&#8217;s mobile and ready to start walking. It&#8217;s going to be a whole new world now.
