Previously, I wrote a post about taking shots of the [resident lion at the zoo][4]. After meandering around the zoo for a while, we went to the [Tropical Forest][5]. Dressed in our winter garb, complete with hats, gloves, and scarves to combat the 20 degree weather and 25 mph winds, we entered the warm, humid Tropical Forest.

[<img class="alignright"  src="http://blog.9minutesnooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/3242983750_91afccaa02.jpg" alt="Lemur" width="333" height="500" />][6]Where I was able to shoot at 1/1000&#8243; at f/2.8 and ISO 200 outside, inside was another matter. I walked around for awhile, checking out the Gorillas, various birds, some hog-like creature, and various other animals when I found the lemurs. A whole bunch of them. Though their environment was naturally lit via skylights, it was still pretty dang dark, and behind a thick pane of reflective glass. I immediately knew I would have to start shooting at ISO 1600. Knowing we were going inside, I had borrowed Erik&#8217;s monopod, so thankfully I would be able to keep my non-IS [Canon 70-200 f/2.8L][7] lens steady. Recall from the [previous post][4] that at a minimum, one needs to shoot at 1/efl (effective focal length) if hand-holding a camera. Using a monopod greatly reduces that requirement, though and I was able to shoot down to 1/30&#8243; and still get sharp pictures, even at 200mm. I was still shooting Aperture Priority Mode with Exposure Compensation to +1/3 stop on my Canon Rebel XTi/400D at f/2.8 to let enough light in and to get a nice shallow depth of field. When I started shooting these rapidly moving little buggers, I was getting between 1/30&#8243; and 1/60&#8243; for a shutter speed! That&#8217;s a full 7-8 stops darker than what I was finding outside. Thank goodness for that monopod and fast lens!

When I used to shoot with my Canon S2 IS point and shoot camera, I wouldn&#8217;t even bother taking a shot if I had to go over ISO 200 and ISO 400 was a grainy mess. The world of DSLRs changes that. Now, I don&#8217;t hesitate to shoot at ISO 1600. Heck, ISO 400 is kind of my starting point and I adjust from there. Sure, 800 and 1600 are noisier than lower ISO settings, but *if you get a good exposure*, [exposing to the right][8], the noise is not objectionable at all, especially once you take a 10mp image and reduce it to an 800&#215;600 image on the screen. Even printed 8&#215;10&#8243;, the noise just doesn&#8217;t really show up&#8230;.if you got the exposure right. I can&#8217;t emphasize this enough &#8211; an under exposed low ISO image will have more objectionable noise than a well exposed high ISO image. So, if the light gets low and bumping up the ISO will allow you to get a better exposure, don&#8217;t be afraid. I tell you, a blurry, dark ISO 400 shot is going to look a heck of a lot worse than a sharp ISO 1600 shot. Plus, if you&#8217;re using flash, you&#8217;ll be able to capture some of the environment and not just end up with a blown out head sticking out of a black hole.

Now the problem wasn&#8217;t camera shake, it was getting the lemurs to stand still long enough to shoot them at such a slow shutter speed. 1/30&#8243; &#8211; 1/60&#8243; is just too slow to capture rapidly moving primates swinging from trees and chasing their friends. I quickly gave up on trying to catch these guys running around playing, so I started focusing on the little guys eating lunch. Did I mention that they were also behind glass? So, I got down low to the floor, got my lens as close to the glass as I could (to eliminate glare) as much as possible, and went to work. Because of the large aperture, long focal lengths, close shooting distances, and subsequently shallow depth of field, I ended up with a lot of well framed shots where a nose, or a claw, or an ear was in crisp focus, but the eyes were not. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s an animal or a human, a portrait just doesn&#8217;t work if the eyes are not in focus. If you can&#8217;t get both eyes in focus, the near eye really needs to be in sharp focus. Also, because of the slow shutter speeds and the spastic creatures, I ended up with a lot of pictures where the fur on the body and arms was in crisp focus, but the head was a blurry mess as they moved their heads around. Again, focusing on the slow moving, feeding lemurs was the way to go and I got several decent shots.

When I got home and downloaded the images into Lightroom (after some warm [Tazo Chai][11]&#8230;mmmmm), I flagged the ones I liked, deleted the total losers (out of focus, blurry, etc), and keyworded them. The lion picture from the last post took a lot of post processing work to get it to pop, but these lemur pictures came out of the camera almost like you see them. For a few of them, I had to bump up the exposure 1/3 of a stop or so. Because I was shooting through glass&#8230;again&#8230;there was a little loss of contrast, so I bumped up the black level a little bit, as well as the contrast and vibrance. Then, I exported them straight to flickr and Facebook with sharpening set to high, using [Jeffrey Friedl&#8217;s][12] [Facebook][13] and [Flickr][14] plugins for Lightroom.

Did you learn something? Have some questions? Am I full of it? Do you hate my photos and wish I&#8217;d shut up about them? Let me know by posting in the comments!
