&#8220;Here I am!&#8221;

Anyone who has played peekaboo with their kid will probably recognize the above exchange.Â  It&#8217;s been seven months since I last updated the blog (Why do I feel like I&#8217;m going into a confession booth or something?) and the picture here should explain why.Â  That&#8217;s my son, John, born May 7th, 2009.Â Â  With the new addition to the household has come a big change in my photographic focus.Â  I barely ever have a lens other than the Canon EF 50mm/1.8 onÂ  anymore.Â  It&#8217;s just the right focal length forÂ  portraits of my little guy and I can take indoor shots at ISO 1600 at f/1.8 with a nice shallow depth of field.Â  I have also been playing around with off camera lighting a lot recently.Â  Most of the time I keep one flash on a stand with an umbrella ready to go and one bare.Â  I&#8217;ve gotten pretty decent at guessing the right settings to use to get the effect I want.Â  This shot of my son with his Turtle Truck (and his tongue hanging out) is an example where I just grabbed two flashes and started playing.Â  You can see from the catch-lights in his eyes that I have two strobes set up, one small (or far away) and one larger (or closer).Â  In this case, it was a shoot-through umbrella camera right and a bare strobe camera left for fill.

[<img class="alignright" src="http://blog.9minutesnooze.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/4012704032_4879633d91.jpg" alt="Just a little drool" width="500" height="500" />][2]But this post isn&#8217;t about lighting.Â  It&#8217;s about Lightroom.Â  With the thousands of pictures I&#8217;ve taken of my son, I&#8217;ve managed to figure out a few quick and dirty tricks to edit these pictures fairly quickly.Â  Since the eyes are the window to the soul, it is critical that they &#8220;pop.&#8221;Â  Most of my editing involves getting the eyes to look great without looking unnatural.Â  Of course, the process begins when you are taking the shot &#8211; **put that focus point right on the eye nearest to you.** If you didn&#8217;t get the focus right on the eyes in your original exposure, no amount of post-processing will help andÂ  you might as well just try again.Â  Note, this is easier said than done with a 6 month old who is learning to crawl and thinks that the big box in front of Daddy&#8217;s face is oh so interesting.

After adjusting exposure and getting rid of any obvious blemishes with the healing tool, I do a few things:

*   Soften skin by lowering Clarity to approximatelyÂ  -15.Â  Clarity adjusts the edge contrast and lowering it has the effect of softening skin.Â  Raising it brings out the blemishes.
*   Add a sharpen mask &#8211; I zoom in on the eyes then hold down the Option key (Mac) and drag the Masking slider around until the skin texture isn&#8217;t being affected and only the eyes are showing with white lines in them.Â  Holding down the option key shows you a gray-scale version of the sharpening mask being used &#8211; light areas will be sharpened and dark areas will not.Â Â  Masking basically sets the threshold for when sharpening will be applied.Â Â  By moving the mask slider (with the option key pressed) until skin texture isn&#8217;t being affected, you are essentially applying the sharpening only to the areas where you want it.Â Â  I tend to apply the mask in the 80-100 range, which filters out most skin textures.

*   Sharpen &#8211; This is where things begin to really pop off the screen.Â  You&#8217;ve set up your skin to be nice and soft and masked off the areas you don&#8217;t want affected.Â  Now drag that sharpening slider to the right.Â  Keep going.Â  A little more.Â  Yup, that&#8217;s it.Â  With the masking set to affect such a small area, you can afford to apply a liberal dose of sharpening.Â  I will often have my sharpening set in the 80-110 range.Â  You&#8217;ll have to use your judgment, though.Â  If it looks unnatural, back it off a little, or increase the mask a bit more.
*   Make the colors pop &#8211; Now play with the Vibrance setting to really make the eye color pop.Â  You can also use the selective saturation controls and select a color from the eye.Â  I like using Vibrance because it only adjusts colors that aren&#8217;t already saturated resulting in a much more natural look.

One of the failings of Lightroom is that you can&#8217;t actually see the results of your work unless you are zoomed in, which is probably not how you will eventually be viewing the image.Â  So, there is a little of trial and error involved and may result in you exporting your image a few times. I understand that this will be rectified in Adobe Lightroom 3 (now in beta).Â  In the end, with a well exposed, correctly focused picture, this recipe should get you some pretty decent eyes without having to have 15 different layers set up in Photoshop.

That&#8217;s all for now.Â  Let me know if there is a topic you would like me to write about in the future!
