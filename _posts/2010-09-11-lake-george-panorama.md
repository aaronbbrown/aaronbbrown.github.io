    It was a nice weekend afternoon, so my wife and I decided to hike up Shelving Rock Mountain (along with 25 lbs of wiggling one year old on my back).Â  We have hiked there before, and observed a great view, but missed the even better unobstructed panoramic view of Lake George and the Adirondacks only a short walk away.Â  Because I was carrying my son on my back, I opted to go light on the camera gear and only had a 50mm lens.Â  That wasn&#8217;t going to stop me from capturing the view! 27 shots (9&#215;3) and 120mp later, and I had the shot you see here.

    I assembled the panorama with Photoshop CS5 and then had to cut it down to 1/4 the original size in order to work with it because my machine was so bogged down.Â  There were a few edges that didn&#8217;t quite get filled in and content aware fill really saved the day here.Â  In retrospect, while it would have been nice to have had a wide lens up there, I&#8217;m glad I took the 50 because it forced me to think a little creatively to come up with the shot I wanted.
